## Clear windows registry network profiles

This project is to help mitigate an anoying bug in Windows 10. Every time one connected an ethernetcable it would create a new network profile, even if it had been connected to that network before.

This program is an accessable tool that lists the ethernet network profiles on win10 and allows a user to delete them quickly.

Built using Windows Forms and modifies registry settings on Windows 10.

Made in 2020.
